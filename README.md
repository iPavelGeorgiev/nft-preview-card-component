## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first attempt to use Sass in a challenge. I was able to learn about the benefits of using partials, mixins, and variables. Learning how to structure my Sass files using the 7-1 pattern was also a big step in improving the readability of my code. Another thing I got a better understanding of was how SVG images work and the benefits of using them.
